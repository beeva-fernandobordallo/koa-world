### Notes.

The framework is very easy to get a hold of if you've worked with express before. Cool modules to play around with:

- [Koa Router](https://github.com/alexmingoia/koa-router)
- [i18n with Koa](https://github.com/koa-modules/i18n)
- [HTTP Logging with koa-morgan](https://github.com/koa-modules/morgan)
- [Static File Serving](https://github.com/koa-modules/serve-static)
